# ShipPost - ShipPost Config

## Product
Build in Public automation tool. Converts git commits into social media posts automatically. AI picks the interesting updates, matches your voice, posts to the right platforms.

## Goal
Build audience in the indie hacker / vibe coding space. Establish Danny as a builder who ships fast.

## Target Audience
- Indie hackers building in public
- Vibe coders using AI tools (Cursor, Claude)
- Developers who want to grow their audience

## Competitors to Avoid Tipping Off
- None - this is open source, we share everything

## Smart Mode Routing

### IMMEDIATE Posts (AI deems exciting - posts right away)
**Platforms**: X (@dannyveigatx)
**Content**: Major features, milestones, "shipped!" moments, technical breakthroughs

### DAILY DIGEST Posts (AI deems routine - batched for 6pm)
**Platforms**: Personal FB
**Content**: Bug fixes, refactors, minor updates, documentation

## Post Guidelines

### Full Posts (X)
- Feature announcements with code snippets welcome
- Behind-the-scenes of building with AI
- Celebrate the "shipped it" moments
- Tag relevant AI tools (@ClaudeAI, @cursor_ai)

### Light Updates (Personal FB)
- Quick "just shipped" updates
- Progress screenshots
- Keep it casual

## Voice Notes
- Lowercase is fine
- Real talk, not corporate
- Celebrate small wins
- Mention when AI helped build something
- Self-deprecating humor okay

## Hashtags & Mentions
- #buildinpublic
- @ClaudeAI when AI-related
