## Example Posts

### Example 1
```
just shipped ShipPost - auto-posting from git commits. build in public on autopilot

the irony of using an AI to write posts about building with AI is not lost on me

#buildinpublic
```

### Example 2
```
shipped fb groups posting for shippost today then immediately had to fix the account connections

classic move fast and break things moment - but hey, cross-platform automation is messy work
```

### Example 3
```
TIL: Post-Bridge API is $5/month and handles Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, FB all in one call

spent way too long trying to build this myself before finding it
```
