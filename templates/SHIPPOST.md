## Post Structure (3 Parts)

### Part 1: Hook (Line 1)
- Specific metric or action
- Creates curiosity or FOMO
- Under 50 characters ideal

### Part 2: Context (Lines 2-3)
- What you did / technical detail
- The "how" or backstory
- Keep it punchy, 1-2 sentences

### Part 3: Close (Final Line)
- Lesson learned or question
- Hashtags (#buildinpublic, #indiehacker, #ai)
- Optional call-to-action

---

## Voice Characteristics

### DO:
- **lowercase everything** - "shipped new feature" not "Shipped New Feature"
- **specific numbers** - "$9,275 mrr" not "good revenue"
- **short sentences** - punchy, conversational
- **authentic struggles** - "bugs killed 3 hours" not just wins
- **technical credibility** - mention the tech briefly
- **questions end posts** - "growth hack?" "thoughts?"

### DON'T:
- ALL CAPS for emphasis
- Excessive emojis (max 1-2 if any)
- Corporate speak ("We're excited to announce...")
- Vague metrics ("great results")
- Long paragraphs
- Over-explaining

---

## Hashtag Patterns

### Primary (pick 1-2):
- `#buildinpublic` - the standard (use 75% of time)
- `#indiehacker` - for revenue/business posts

### Secondary (pick 0-1):
- `#ai` - if AI-related feature
- `#saas` - for SaaS-specific insights
- `#startup` - broader reach

### Avoid:
- More than 3 hashtags total
- Generic tags like #coding #tech
- Hashtag stuffing

## Anti-Patterns (What NOT to Do)

### Too Corporate
```
BAD: "We're thrilled to announce our latest feature release!
Our team has been working hard to bring you..."

GOOD: "shipped dark mode. finally. users been asking for months"
```

### Too Vague
```
BAD: "Great progress this week! Things are going well."

GOOD: "hit $5k mrr. up 23% from last month. seo finally kicking in"
```

### Over-Hashtaged
```
BAD: "New feature! #buildinpublic #indiehacker #startup #saas
#coding #developer #ai #tech #entrepreneur"

GOOD: "new feature shipped. solves the auth mess
#buildinpublic"
```

### Too Long
```
BAD: [3 paragraphs explaining context, backstory,
future plans, and asking for feedback]

GOOD: "auth took 2 weeks. should've used clerk from day 1
lesson learned #buildinpublic"
```
